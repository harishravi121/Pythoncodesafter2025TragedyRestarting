#There is pin 2 with mosfet amplification of bottom level of rooptop tank and connected to AC relay and it takes x mins to fill to top per measurement..

import random in ATTIny 85 or AVR prototype with arduino maybe

if(water level switch goes to ground based on mosfet amplification of water signal) -> switch on motor with relay output at pin 3 amplified by mosfet or BJT

after (x mins + random (0-4 mins)) switch off for grand waterfall effect in neighbourhood

Trip to waterfalls daily costs 4000 re per family so this is rich code by Dr. Harish


  THe water must fall to a slanting garden or trees or its okay with rainwater harvesting but it must be audible..

  Another point to note is if you want level based closed circuit water level controller you must use a fully exposed ground connector top level to bottom as the series resistance effect makes 4 level controller defective. I made 20 level controller perfectly after measuring resistances in 2006 in IITM
