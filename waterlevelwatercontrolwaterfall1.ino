#There is pin 2 with mosfet amplification of bottom level and connected to AC relay and it takes x mins to fill to top per measurement..

import random in ATTIny 85 or AVR

if(water level switch goes to ground based on mosfet amplification of water signal) -> switch on motor with relay output at pin 3 amplified by mosfet or BJT

after (x mins + random (0-4 mins)) switch off for grand waterfall effect in neighbourhood

Trip to waterfalls daily costs 4000 re per family so this is rich code by Dr. Harish
