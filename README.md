# Pythoncodesafter2025TragedyRestarting
There were some issues and wonder if the next set of same essential codes will succeed when bored

Can just write roulette code on day 1..


Life in coding is like a game of snakes and ladders sometimes if combined problems occur we have to restart and have fun like  I wrote a server code recently but put it in humanoid repo and can't remember. so let those interested try from there?

next sorting, plotting, rms data analaysis, prime no  etc we have to see an example (or ask ai for an example) or NPTEL Lectures..
