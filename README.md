# Pythoncodesafter2025TragedyRestarting
There were some issues and wonder if the next set of same essential codes will succeed when bored

Can just write roulette code on day 1..

next challenge is to use interrupt and debouncing button for time travel in arduino clock by say fixed amount and back like in IITM mars rover with team of 4
Life in coding is like a game of snakes and ladders sometimes if combined problems occur we have to restart and have fun like  

next sorting, plotting, rms data analaysis, prime no  etc we have to see an example (or ask ai for an example) or NPTEL Lectures..

To write code enough to start a business leadership we need premium ai for months say we collect 100 simple prob lems and make 1 month ai or even share to keep making such code..
