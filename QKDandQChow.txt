If you can produce a entangled photon pair

How would you even transmit a secure bit BY MEASURING SOMETHING WITH GAPD ON BOTH SIDES I forgot.. I was lord of it till someone  TOOK OXFORD MARK FOX JUST LIKE OXFORD BOOK ON ATOMS WAS BEST..


THe biggest mistake was feeling like encrypting that due to spirit of book and not teaching it over email to friends..


Teaching the QKD Algorithm after relearning now might be the key in this level or at the college level itself for the philosophers stone..


Someone even said generating entanglement with atomic vapor is easy with 20dB proof,

Similarly if you had an entangled atom how can you compute faster and how to generate it? WIll revise..
