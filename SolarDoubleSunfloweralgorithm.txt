loop{
motor on at 180 deg rotation per 12 hrs motor (USE PWM, HBridge and a thread to attach at end with counter weight.. callibrate timer factor in 6 hrs)
delay (12 hrs)
rewind at 180 deg rotation per min with high current
delay(1 min)
delay (12) hr idle

ideal solar terrestial code..

just 200 re Arduino chip with pwm and h bridge..
A 10 MW facility can become 20MW facility saving 10 crores from thin air.. lol

Another suggestion near equator like india could be

mount at 30 deg after 3 hrs rotate by 60 deg to be perfect horizontal and after 6 hrs rotate 30 deg to face other way and after 3 hrs come back to first.. no need of perfect tracking..
