loop{
motor on at 180 deg rotation per 12 hrs motor (USE PWM, HBridge and a thread to attach at end with counter weight.. callibrate timer factor in 6 hrs)
delay (12 hrs)
rewind at 180 deg rotation per min with high current
delay(1 min)
delay (12) hr idle

ideal solar terrestial code..

just 200 re Arduino chip with pwm and h bridge..
