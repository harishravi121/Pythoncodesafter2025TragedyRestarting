Use 2 colors of half squared
Mid point to mid point is vector of bot

Let object be at some position of a particular color and that color gives center


loop{
 rotate difference in vector to center of object the angle by rotating till the value is zero
 move forward 10 seconds
 }

after first loop you will just be error correcting till you reach object and capture in front box

then observe dock color and find center

loop{
 rotate difference in vector to center of dock the angle by rotating till the value is zero
 move forward 10 seconds
 }

Repeat for all objects this is shaastra final year 2nd prize code


Didn't think this can be used for e connerce or even auto driving cars as a back up
