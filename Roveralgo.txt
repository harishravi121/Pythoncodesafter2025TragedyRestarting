loop{
Move straight or back randmly (random seconds)
Trun randomly left or right randomly with differential turning of 4wd motor(random seconds)
  }


WOuld be a gaussian probability to find bot from center of release... It would be nice to sell 1 billion room rover as discussed with IIT friends or any college or at home company as pet

A second layer is interrupt 1 hr move 10 min forward 
With this you can do surveylance of an entire planet or satellite like moon nars etc

For obstacle or ditch 2nd interrupt in or gate of all front down etc sensors then identify go back 5 seconds turn 4 seconds

Needs patience and funding hope to write exact code or will students be inbterested?

There is something called arbit interrupts due to electromagnetic induction from motors and this needs heavy debouncing code loops of interrupts

Tried 4wd after seeing failure in 1st competition in sand manual race lift and saw winning bot had 4wd
