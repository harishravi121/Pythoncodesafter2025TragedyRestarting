LED BUILTIN means wire connected to motor also..
void setup() {
  
  //LED should be connected to transistor and relay for pump and a for loop for 1000 should be written around delay as its in milliseconds
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever: this delay is in ms or seconds it doesn't matter much a random prefactor can be added too for beauty
void loop() {
  long delayoff=3*60*3600+random(something0);
  long delayon=20+random(something);

  delay(delayoff);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(delayon);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  }

//can add some random delays as cushions in between appropriately some waterfall effect is also good
//one can make a verilog code to directly make it at factory with ai and as small as possible 

//Trip to waterfalls daily costs 4000 re per family so this is rich code by Dr. Harish


//  THe water must fall to a slanting garden or trees or its okay with rainwater harvesting but it must be audible..

 // If you add a plastic ball float with timer plus random you can avoid waterfall losses too..

This needs no wiring to top floor  and climbing etc..
